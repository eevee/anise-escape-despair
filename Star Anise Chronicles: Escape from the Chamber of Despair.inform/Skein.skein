You struggle and cry for help, but your captor ignores your feeble pleas.  They toss you, like garbage, into the darkness.  The heavy gate closes and locks behind you, sealing your fate.  Their maniacal laughter echoes into the distance, leaving you alone with your thoughts.

You are trapped.  Trapped...  in the Chamber of Despair.

Star Anise Chronicles: Escape from the Chamber of Despair
An Interactive Fiction by Evelyn Woods
Release 1 / Serial number 191221 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Neon&apos;s bedroom
The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow coming from Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the tall machine in the corner.

The desk, with a drawer underneath, and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  Some shelves take up the opposite wall, stopping short of the corner to make room for a tall machine.  In the center of the room is a bed, unmade, a blanket hanging half off one side; it&apos;s framed by a nightstand and a closet door in the western wall.  The bedroom door to the east is closed, of course, but the glowing panel next to it might be useful.

A little white pamphlet lies on the floor near the door.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, all of which is soft and comfortable under your paws.

(From down here, you can&apos;t see what&apos;s on the various raised surfaces around the room.)

&quot;No!  Let me nap!!!&quot;

&quot;Yeah!!  A nap after we escape sounds great!!  Team Star Purrl Anise Fish Squad let&apos;s go!!&quot;

Neon&apos;s bedroom
The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow coming from Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the tall machine in the corner.

The desk and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  Some shelves take up the opposite wall, stopping short of the corner to make room for a tall machine.  In the center of the room is a bed, unmade, a blanket hanging half off one side; it&apos;s framed by a nightstand and a closet door in the western wall.  The bedroom door to the east is, of course, closed.

From down here, you can&apos;t see what&apos;s on the various raised surfaces around the room: the bed, nightstand, desk, workbench, and shelves.

A little white pamphlet lies on the floor near the door.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, all of which is soft and comfortable under your paws.  Purrl has found a nice shirt to wrap around herself.  Also on the floor are a glue stick and a bag of glitter.

&quot;Mmmmnnmnnmm, I dunno.&quot;  Purrl licks her paw in a lovely manner.  &quot;But okay.  But only if you don&apos;t bother M.O.R.S.E.L.&quot;

Neon&apos;s bedroom
The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow coming from Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the strange machine in the corner.

The desk and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  Some shelves take up the opposite wall, stopping short of the corner to make room for a strange machine.  In the center of the room is a bed, unmade, a blanket hanging half off one side; it&apos;s framed by a nightstand and a closet door.  The bedroom door is, of course, closed behind you.

From the floor, you can&apos;t see what&apos;s on the various raised surfaces around the room: the bed, nightstand, desk, workbench, and shelves.

Neon&apos;s bedroom
The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow coming from Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the tall machine in the corner.

The desk and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  Some shelves take up the opposite wall, stopping short of the corner to make room for a tall machine.  In the center of the room is a bed, unmade, a blanket hanging half off one side; it&apos;s framed by a nightstand and a closet door in the western wall.  The bedroom door to the east is, of course, closed.

From down here, you can&apos;t see what&apos;s on the various raised surfaces around the room: the bed, nightstand, desk, workbench, and shelves.

A little white pamphlet lies on the floor near the door.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, all of which is soft and comfortable under your paws.  Also on the floor are a glue stick and a bag of glitter.

    <result xml:space="preserve">Neon&apos;s bedroom (on the bed)
The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow coming from Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the tall machine in the corner.

The desk and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  Some shelves take up the opposite wall, stopping short of the corner to make room for a tall machine.  In the center of the room is a bed, unmade, a blanket hanging half off one side; it&apos;s framed by a nightstand and a closet door in the western wall.  The bedroom door to the east is, of course, closed.

From your vantage point atop the bed, you could see what&apos;s on the various other raised surfaces around the room (the nightstand, desk, workbench, and shelves), if you cared to take a look.

A little white pamphlet lies on the floor near the door.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, all of which is soft and comfortable under your paws.  Also on the floor are a glue stick and a bag of glitter.

The blanket strewn haphazardly across the bed bears a circuit pattern, as well as a conspicuous lump in the middle.

The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow coming from Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the tall machine in the corner.

The desk, with a drawer underneath, and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  Some shelves take up the opposite wall, stopping short of the corner to make room for a tall machine.  In the center of the room is a bed, unmade, a blanket hanging half off one side; it&apos;s framed by a nightstand and a closet door in the western wall.  The bedroom door to the east is, of course, closed.

    <result xml:space="preserve">Neon&apos;s bedroom (on Purrl) (on the bed)
The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow from the terminal on Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the strange machine in the corner.

The desk and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  shelves take up the opposite wall, except for a strange machine in the corner.  In the center of the room is a bed, unmade; beside it is a nightstand, then a closet door.  The bedroom door is, of course, closed behind you.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, which is soft and nice to stand on.

On the bed you can see a pillow and a blanket (empty).

The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow coming from Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the strange machine in the corner.

The desk and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  Some shelves take up the opposite wall, stopping short of the corner to make room for a strange machine.  In the center of the room is a bed; it&apos;s framed by a nightstand and a closet door in the western wall.  The bedroom door to the east is, of course, closed.

From down here, you can&apos;t see what&apos;s on the various raised surfaces around the room: the bed, nightstand, desk, workbench, and shelves.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, all of which is soft and comfortable under your paws.  Purrl has found a nice shirt to wrap around herself.  Also down here is a blanket.

A little white pamphlet lies on the floor near the door.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, all of which is soft and comfortable under your paws.  Purrl has found a nice shirt to wrap around herself.  Also on the floor are a blanket, a glue stick, and a bag of glitter.

On Purrl you can see a Lily figurine.

    <result xml:space="preserve">Neon&apos;s bedroom (on Purrl)
The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow from the terminal on Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the strange machine in the corner.

The desk and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  shelves take up the opposite wall, except for a strange machine in the corner.  In the center of the room is a bed, unmade; on either side are a nightstand and a closet door.  The bedroom door is, of course, closed behind you.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, which is soft and nice to stand on.

On the bed is nothing.

On the nightstand is nothing.

A terminal sits here, radiating importance and cyan light.

You can also see a blanket here.

The desk and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  shelves take up the opposite wall, except for a strange machine in the corner.  In the center of the room is a bed, unmade; on either side are a nightstand and a closet door.  The bedroom door is, of course, closed behind you.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, which is soft and nice to stand on.

On the bed is nothing.

You can also see a yellow star, Purrl, and a blanket here.

&quot;Mewo!!  That&apos;s enough, Star Anise!  Get off of me!!&quot;  Purrl shakes her head back and forth, sending you tumbling to the floor.

Neon&apos;s bedroom
The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow coming from Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the tall machine in the corner.

The desk and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  Some shelves take up the opposite wall, stopping short of the corner to make room for a tall machine.  In the center of the room is a bed; it&apos;s framed by a nightstand and a closet door in the western wall.  The bedroom door to the east is, of course, closed.

From down here, you can&apos;t see what&apos;s on the various raised surfaces around the room: the bed, nightstand, desk, workbench, and shelves.

A little white pamphlet lies on the floor near the door.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, all of which is soft and comfortable under your paws.  Purrl has found a nice shirt to wrap around herself.  Also on the floor are a blanket, a glue stick, and a bag of glitter.

Tip: X is short for EXAMINE!

You flip through the rest of the pamphlet, which contains detailed instructions and a complete walkthrough, but there aren&apos;t any pictures!  Not one!  Worthless.

Purrl puts her paws squarely on her hips.  &quot;I&apos;m not giving you any boots!  Find something else to stand on!!&quot;

&quot;Like what??  Everything in here is real big or real shirt!&quot;  You stand on one of the dirty shirts on the floor.  &quot;Look it doesn&apos;t make me any taller at all!  Not even one taller.&quot;

&quot;Mmmmnnmnnmm, I dunno.&quot;  Purrl licks her paw in a lovely manner.  &quot;But okay.  But only if you don&apos;t bother M.O.R.S.E.L.&quot;

The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow coming from Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the tall machine in the corner.

The desk and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  Some shelves take up the opposite wall, stopping short of the corner to make room for a tall machine.  In the center of the room is a bed; it&apos;s framed by a nightstand and a closet door in the western wall.  The bedroom door to the east is, of course, closed.

You get onto the workbench.

A broad flat plain stretches out in front of you.

On the workbench you can see a mug, a construction paper, some scissors, and a laser engraver.

It&apos;s your best friend, Purrl!  The two of you sure have had a lot of exciting adventures together!  You fondly reminisce about some of them, like the time you were trapped in the Chamber of Despair.

She catches you staring at her and scowls.  M.O.R.S.E.L., the fish swimming around inside her helmet who likes you just as much as Purrl does, also seems to scowl.

You struggle and cry for help, but your captor ignores your feeble pleas.  They toss you, like garbage, into the darkness.  The heavy gate closes and locks behind you, sealing your fate.  Their maniacal laughter echoes into the distance, leaving you alone with your thoughts.

You are trapped.  Trapped...  in the Chamber of Despair.

Star Anise Chronicles: Escape from the Chamber of Despair
An Interactive Fiction by Eevee
Release 1 / Serial number 191216 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Neon&apos;s bedroom
The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow coming from Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the tall machine in the corner.

The desk and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  Some shelves take up the opposite wall, stopping short of the corner to make room for a tall machine.  In the center of the room is a bed, unmade, a blanket hanging half off one side; it&apos;s framed by a nightstand and a closet door in the western wall.  The bedroom door to the east is, of course, closed.

From down here, you can&apos;t see what&apos;s on the various raised surfaces around the room: the bed, nightstand, desk, workbench, and shelves.

A little white pamphlet lies on the floor near the door.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, all of which is soft and comfortable under your paws.  Also on the floor are a glue stick and a bag of glitter.

The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow coming from Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the tall machine in the corner.

The desk, with a drawer underneath, and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  Some shelves take up the opposite wall, stopping short of the corner to make room for a tall machine.  In the center of the room is a bed, unmade, a blanket hanging half off one side; it&apos;s framed by a nightstand and a closet door in the western wall.  The bedroom door to the east is, of course, closed.

A little white pamphlet lies on the floor near the door.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, all of which is soft and comfortable under your paws.

(From your vantage point atop the shelves, you can get a better look at the various other raised surfaces around the room.)

These shelves run all the way to the ceiling and are absolutely jam-packed with a whole bunch of stuff.

You tug on the blanket.  It slides off the bed and on top of you, bringing its contents with it.  A little flailing manages to kick it off of you, and you&apos;re greeted by a scowling face.


Purrl crosses her arms.  &quot;Star Anise!!  What are you doing here!  I was taking a lovely nap, and then I had a nightmare that Star Anise woke me up, and then it wasn&apos;t a nightmare it was real!!  This is my sleep place that I found, go away!!&quot;

You adopt an action pose, to convey how much action you&apos;re currently ready for.  &quot;Oh!!!!!  Purrl!  I&apos;m so glad to see you!!  Listen we&apos;re trapped in the Chamber of Despair and I&apos;ve been trying to go away but I can&apos;t because of the trapped!  We gotta make a daringly cool escape!!  Do you have any explosives or maybe a cool gun.&quot;

&quot;No!  Let me nap!!!&quot;

&quot;Yeah!!  A nap after we escape sounds great!!  Team Star Purrl Anise Fish Squad let&apos;s go!!&quot;

The desk and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  shelves take up the opposite wall, except for a strange machine in the corner.  In the center of the room is a bed, unmade; on either side are a nightstand and a closet door.  The bedroom door is, of course, closed behind you.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, which is soft and nice to stand on.

A terminal sits here, radiating importance and cyan light.

You get onto the bed.

The blanket strewn haphazardly across the bed bears a circuit pattern, as well as a conspicuous lump in the middle.

On the bed you can also see a pillow.

[on the floor] &gt;[1] pull blanket
You tug on the blanket.  It slides off the bed and on top of you, bringing its contents with it.  A little flailing manages to kick it off of you, and you&apos;re greeted by a scowling face.



Purrl crosses her arms.  &quot;Star Anise!!  What are you doing here!  I was taking a lovely nap, and then I had a nightmare that Star Anise woke me up, and then it wasn&apos;t a nightmare it was real!!  This is my sleep place that I found, go away!!&quot;

You adopt an action pose, to convey how much action you&apos;re currently ready for.  &quot;Oh!!!!!  Purrl!  I&apos;m so glad to see you!!  Listen we&apos;re trapped in the Chamber of Despair and I&apos;ve been trying to go away but I can&apos;t because of the trapped!  We gotta make a daringly cool escape!!  Do you have any explosives or maybe a cool gun.&quot;

&quot;No!  Let me nap!!!&quot;

&quot;Yeah!!  A nap after we escape sounds great!!  Team Star Purrl Anise Fish Squad let&apos;s go!!&quot;

[Your score has just gone up by five points.]

[on the floor] &gt;[2] show panel to purrl


You point up at the panel.  &quot;I think that opens the door!!  Also it glows a lot and I wanna touch it.  But it&apos;s too tall up!  Gimme a boost!&quot;

Purrl puts her paws squarely on her hips.  &quot;I&apos;m not giving you any boots!  Find something else to stand on!!&quot;

&quot;Like what??  Everything in here is real big or real shirt!&quot;  You stand on one of the dirty shirts on the floor.  &quot;Look it doesn&apos;t make me any taller at all!  Not even one taller!!  I can&apos;t escape like this!&quot;

&quot;Mmmmnnmnnmmnnnn.  I dunno.&quot;  Purrl licks her paw in a lovely manner.  &quot;But okay.  But only if you don&apos;t bother M.O.R.S.E.L.&quot;

[Your score has just gone up by five points.]

[on the floor] &gt;[3] climb purrl


Purrl reluctantly leans down for you, and you clamber awkwardly on top of her helmet.

[on Purrl] &gt;[4] touch panel
You pap your paws against the panel.  It makes some delightful noises and flashes red for a moment.

You try this a couple times, but to no avail.  &quot;It didn&apos;t work!!  Let me out you dumb lights thing!!&quot;

Purrl frowns up at your butt.  &quot;Can I go do more nap now?&quot;

&quot;No!!!  I have a new idea!!&quot;  You hop down off Purrl&apos;s helmet and kick some laundry around, making a clearing on the floor.  &quot;It&apos;s time to open Star Anise shop!!  It&apos;s the only way!!!!&quot;

&quot;I don&apos;t care about Star Anise shop!!!!&quot;  Purrl takes out her frustrations by helping you kick laundry.

So far, though, it&apos;s nothing more than a clear space on the floor.
It still needs:
- something big with an opening, to act as a stall
- a name painted on the stall
- stars to decorate it
- at least three kinds of high quality merchandise
- a customer

The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow from the terminal on Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the strange machine in the corner.

The desk and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  shelves take up the opposite wall, except for a strange machine in the corner.  In the center of the room is a bed, unmade; on either side are a nightstand and a closet door.  The bedroom door is, of course, closed behind you.

Your new shop is taking shape, though so far it&apos;s just an empty spot on the floor.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, which is soft and nice to stand on.

On the bed is nothing.

On the nightstand is nothing.

A terminal sits here, radiating importance and cyan light.

You can also see Purrl and a blanket here.

You can also see a closet door here.

Neon&apos;s bedroom
The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow from the terminal on Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the strange machine in the corner.

The desk and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  shelves take up the opposite wall, except for a strange machine in the corner.  In the center of the room is a bed, unmade; on either side are a nightstand and a closet door.  The bedroom door is, of course, closed behind you.

Your new shop is taking shape, though so far it&apos;s just an empty spot on the floor.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, which is soft and nice to stand on.

On the bed is nothing.

On the nightstand is nothing.

On the desk is nothing.

On the workbench is nothing.

You can also see Purrl and a blanket here.

    <result xml:space="preserve">Neon&apos;s bedroom (on Purrl)
The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow from the terminal on Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the strange machine in the corner.

The desk and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  shelves take up the opposite wall, except for a strange machine in the corner.  In the center of the room is a bed, unmade; on either side are a nightstand and a closet door.  The bedroom door is, of course, closed behind you.

Your new shop is taking shape, though so far it&apos;s just an empty spot on the floor.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, which is soft and nice to stand on.

On the bed is a pillow.

On the nightstand is a lamp.

On the desk is a terminal.

On the workbench are a mug, some construction paper, and some scissors.

You can also see a blanket here.

Neon&apos;s bedroom (on Purrl)
The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow from the terminal on Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the strange machine in the corner.

The desk and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  shelves take up the opposite wall, except for a strange machine in the corner.  In the center of the room is a bed, unmade; on either side are a nightstand and a closet door.  The bedroom door is, of course, closed behind you.

Your new shop is taking shape, though so far it&apos;s just an empty spot on the floor.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, which is soft and nice to stand on.

On the bed is a pillow.

On the nightstand is a lamp.

On the desk is a terminal.

On the workbench are a mug and some construction paper.

You can also see a blanket here.

Neon&apos;s bedroom
The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow coming from Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the tall machine in the corner.

The desk and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  Some shelves take up the opposite wall, stopping short of the corner to make room for a tall machine.  In the center of the room is a bed; it&apos;s framed by a nightstand and a closet door in the western wall.  The bedroom door to the east is, of course, closed.

From down here, you can&apos;t see what&apos;s on the various raised surfaces around the room: the bed, nightstand, desk, workbench, and shelves.

Your new shop is taking shape!  So far, that shape is a clearing on the floor.

A little white pamphlet lies on the floor near the door.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, all of which is soft and comfortable under your paws.  Purrl has found a nice shirt to wrap around herself.  Also on the floor are a blanket, a glue stick, and a bag of glitter.

The desk and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  Some shelves take up the opposite wall, stopping short of the corner to make room for a tall machine.  In the center of the room is a bed; it&apos;s framed by a nightstand and a closet door in the western wall.  The bedroom door to the east is, of course, closed.

From your vantage point atop the workbench, you could see what&apos;s on the various other raised surfaces around the room (the bed, nightstand, desk, and shelves), if you cared to take a look.

Your new shop is taking shape!  So far, that shape is a clearing on the floor.

A little white pamphlet lies on the floor near the door.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, all of which is soft and comfortable under your paws.  Purrl has found a nice shirt to wrap around herself.  Also on the floor are a blanket, a glue stick, and a bag of glitter.

Neon&apos;s closet
The closet is spacious, which is exciting, but mostly contains clothes, which is not.  Back through the closet door is the bedroom.

What really catches your eye is the cardboard box tucked in the corner.  It&apos;s been taped shut, and one side reads FRAGILE.

Neon&apos;s bedroom
The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow coming from Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the strange machine in the corner.

The desk and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  Some shelves take up the opposite wall, stopping short of the corner to make room for a strange machine.  In the center of the room is a bed; it&apos;s framed by a nightstand and a closet door in the western wall.  The bedroom door to the east is, of course, closed.

From down here, you can&apos;t see what&apos;s on the various raised surfaces around the room: the bed, nightstand, desk, workbench, and shelves.

Your new shop is taking shape!  So far, though, it&apos;s nothing more than a clear space on the floor.


The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, all of which is soft and comfortable under your paws.  Purrl has found a nice shirt to wrap around herself.  Also on the floor is a blanket.

The closet is spacious, which is exciting, but mostly contains clothes, which is not.  Back through the closet door is the bedroom.

What really catches your eye is the cardboard box tucked in the corner.  It&apos;s been taped shut, and one side reads FRAGILE.

Neon&apos;s bedroom
The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow coming from Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the tall machine in the corner.

The desk and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  Some shelves take up the opposite wall, stopping short of the corner to make room for a tall machine.  In the center of the room is a bed; it&apos;s framed by a nightstand and a closet door in the western wall.  The bedroom door to the east is, of course, closed.

From down here, you can&apos;t see what&apos;s on the various raised surfaces around the room: the bed, nightstand, desk, workbench, and shelves.

Your new shop is taking shape!  So far, that shape is a clearing on the floor.

A little white pamphlet lies on the floor near the door.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, all of which is soft and comfortable under your paws.  Purrl has found a nice shirt to wrap around herself.  Also on the floor are a blanket, a glue stick, and a bag of glitter.

In the center of the room is a bed; it&apos;s framed by a nightstand and a closet door in the western wall.  The bedroom door to the east is, of course, closed.

From down here, you can&apos;t see what&apos;s on the various raised surfaces around the room: the bed, nightstand, desk, workbench, and shelves.

Your new shop is taking shape!  So far, that shape is a clearing on the floor.

A little white pamphlet lies on the floor near the door.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, all of which is soft and comfortable under your paws.  Purrl has found a nice shirt to wrap around herself.  Also on the floor are a blanket, a glue stick, and a bag of glitter.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, all of which is soft and comfortable under your paws.  Purrl has found a nice shirt to wrap around herself.  Also on the floor are some broken pieces of a mug, a blanket, a glue stick, and a bag of glitter.

(From your vantage point atop the workbench, you can get a better look at the various other raised surfaces around the room.)

A broad flat plain stretches out in front of you.

On the workbench you can see a construction paper and some scissors.

The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow coming from Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the tall machine in the corner.

The desk, with a drawer underneath, and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  Some shelves take up the opposite wall, stopping short of the corner to make room for a tall machine.  In the center of the room is a bed; it&apos;s framed by a nightstand and a closet door in the western wall.  The bedroom door to the east is, of course, closed.

The workbench is a warm painted wood, in stark contrast to the cold metal desk right next to it.  This is where the magic happens, if &quot;magic&quot; is the appearance of a lot of things that roll around.

On the workbench you can see a mug and some construction paper.

Neon&apos;s bedroom
The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow coming from Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the tall machine in the corner.

The desk and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  Some shelves take up the opposite wall, stopping short of the corner to make room for a tall machine.  In the center of the room is a bed; it&apos;s framed by a nightstand and a closet door in the western wall.  The bedroom door to the east is, of course, closed.

From down here, you can&apos;t see what&apos;s on the various raised surfaces around the room: the bed, nightstand, desk, workbench, and shelves.

Your new shop is taking shape!  So far, that shape is a clearing on the floor.

A little white pamphlet lies on the floor near the door.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, all of which is soft and comfortable under your paws.  Purrl has found a nice shirt to wrap around herself.  Also on the floor are a blanket, a glue stick, and a bag of glitter.

&gt;[1] get on purrl
You clamber awkwardly on top of Purrl&apos;s helmet.

&gt;[2] open closet
You grasp the doorknob in both paws and wrestle with it a bit.  It unlatches, and the door swings open!  You did it!!

Purrl folds her arms.

&gt;[3] get on workbench
You hop from Purrl&apos;s helmet onto the workbench.

&gt;[4] take scissors
You pick up the scissors.

&gt;[5] down
You hop down off of the workbench.

Neon&apos;s bedroom
The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow coming from Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the tall machine in the corner.

The desk and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  Some shelves take up the opposite wall, stopping short of the corner to make room for a tall machine.  In the center of the room is a bed; it&apos;s framed by a nightstand and a closet door in the western wall.  The bedroom door to the east is, of course, closed.

Your new shop is taking shape!  So far, that shape is a clearing on the floor.

A little white pamphlet lies on the floor near the door.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, all of which is soft and comfortable under your paws.  Purrl has found a nice shirt to wrap around herself.  Also on the floor are a blanket, a glue stick, and a bag of glitter.

(From down here, you can&apos;t see what&apos;s on the various raised surfaces around the room.)

&gt;[6] go in closet

Neon&apos;s closet
The closet is spacious, which is exciting, but mostly contains clothes, which is not.  Back through the closet door is the bedroom.

What really catches your eye is the cardboard box tucked in the corner.  It&apos;s been taped shut, and one side reads FRAGILE.

&gt;[7] cut tape
You painstakingly cut at the tape, which is much more difficult than it seems with these scissors, but manage to free the box flaps!

&gt;[8] open box
You open the cardboard box, revealing some electronic junk.

&gt;[9] take junk
You grab bits and pieces at random and toss them over your shoulder, emptying the box one circuit board at a time.  The delicate components clatter as they hit the wall and floor behind you.

&gt;[10] push box out
You shove the box ahead of you and manage to finagle it through the door.

Purrl sticks her tongue out at you when you&apos;re not looking.

&gt;[11] flip box
You flip the box over, converting it elegantly into a stall for your shop!  You nudge it into position and gaze upon it with pride.

The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow coming from Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the tall machine in the corner.

The desk and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  Some shelves take up the opposite wall, stopping short of the corner to make room for a tall machine.  In the center of the room is a bed; it&apos;s framed by a nightstand and a closet door in the western wall.  The bedroom door to the east is, of course, closed.

Your new shop is taking shape!  It has a stall!

A little white pamphlet lies on the floor near the door.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, all of which is soft and comfortable under your paws.  Purrl has found a nice shirt to wrap around herself.  Also on the floor are a blanket, a glue stick, and a bag of glitter.

(From down here, you can&apos;t see what&apos;s on the various raised surfaces around the room.)

Purrl blows some bubbles in her helmet.

[on the floor] &gt;[1] get on purrl
Purrl reluctantly leans down for you, and you clamber awkwardly on top of her helmet.

[on Purrl] &gt;[2] open closet
You grasp the doorknob in both paws and wrestle with it a bit.  It unlatches, and the door swings open!  You did it!!

Purrl clears her throat loudly.

[Your score has just gone up by five points.]

[on Purrl] &gt;[3] get on nightstand
You hop from Purrl&apos;s helmet onto the nightstand.

[on the nightstand] &gt;[4] take scissors
You pick up the scissors.

Purrl thinks about the blanket.

[on the nightstand, holding some scissors] &gt;[5] down
You hop down off of the nightstand.

[on the floor, holding some scissors] &gt;[6] go in closet

Neon&apos;s closet
The closet is spacious, which is exciting, but mostly contains clothes, which is not.  Back through the closet door is the bedroom.

What really catches your eye is the cardboard box tucked in the corner.  It&apos;s been taped shut, and one side reads FRAGILE.

[in the closet, holding some scissors] &gt;[7] cut tape
You painstakingly cut at the tape, which is much more difficult than it seems with these scissors, but manage to free the box flaps!

[in the closet, holding some scissors] &gt;[8] open box
You open the cardboard box, revealing some electronic junk.

[Your score has just gone up by five points.]

[in the closet, holding some scissors] &gt;[9] take junk


You grab bits and pieces at random and toss them over your shoulder, emptying the box one circuit board at a time.  The delicate components clatter as they hit the wall and floor behind you.

[in the closet, holding some scissors] &gt;[10] push box out
You shove the box ahead of you and manage to finagle it through the door.

Purrl gently pokes the blanket.

[on the floor, holding some scissors] &gt;[11] flip box


You flip the box over, converting it elegantly into a stall for your shop!  You nudge it into position and gaze upon it with pride.

[Your score has just gone up by five points.]

[on the floor, holding some scissors] &gt;[12] drop scissors
Dropped.

Purrl dusts off her tail.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, all of which is soft and comfortable under your paws.  Purrl has found a nice shirt to wrap around herself.  Also on the floor are some scissors, a blanket, a glue stick, and a bag of glitter.

(From down here, you can&apos;t see what&apos;s on the various raised surfaces around the room.)

Purrl gently pokes the glue stick.

Neon&apos;s bedroom
The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow coming from Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the tall machine in the corner.

The desk and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  Some shelves take up the opposite wall, stopping short of the corner to make room for a tall machine.  In the center of the room is a bed; it&apos;s framed by a nightstand and a closet door in the western wall.  The bedroom door to the east is, of course, closed.

[on the floor] &gt;[1] climb shelves
You make your way up the shelves.  They&apos;re too short for your helmet to fit in, so the best you can do is hold onto them like a ladder.

The shelves stretch all the way up to the ceiling, but you can climb around on them pretty easily.

On the shelves you can see a bunch of stuff.

[on the shelves] &gt;[2] knock stuff down
You methodically knock every single object off of the shelves.  While you&apos;re doing so, you take particular notice of a bag of glitter and a spool of twine.

[Your score has just gone up by two points.]

[on the shelves] &gt;[3] down
You hop down off of the shelves.

Purrl yawns.

[on the floor] &gt;[4] look under workbench
You peek around under the workbench, and way in the back by the wall, you spot a tiny jar of paint!  It must&apos;ve fallen off sometime.  Probably because you were batting it around.

You fish it out and clutch it excitedly in your paws.

[Your score has just gone up by two points.]

[on the floor, holding a tiny jar of paint] &gt;[5] drop
(the tiny jar of paint)
Dropped.

[on the floor] &gt;[6] look under desk
You crouch on all fours and peer under the desk.  Right there in front of you is a glue stick!  This is the high point of your day so far.

You roll it towards you and pick it up.

[Your score has just gone up by two points.]

[on the floor, holding a glue stick] &gt;[7] drop
(the glue stick)
Dropped.

[on the floor] &gt;[8] get on workbench
You get onto the workbench.

The workbench is a warm painted wood, in stark contrast to the cold metal desk right next to it.  This is where the magic happens, if &quot;magic&quot; is the appearance of a lot of things that roll around.

On the workbench you can see a mug and some construction paper.

[on the workbench] &gt;[9] push mug
You bat at the mug a few times, and it finally drops to the floor.

The laundry cushioned its fall, but the mug didn&apos;t survive unscathed.  It&apos;s now chipped.

Purrl whispers to M.O.R.S.E.L.
.

[on the workbench] &gt;[10] push paper
You bat at the construction paper a few times, and it finally drops to the floor.

[on the workbench] &gt;[11] down
You hop down off of the workbench.

[on the floor] &gt;[12] get on desk
You get onto the desk.

The metal desk is surprisingly sparse, occupied mainly by a glowing terminal.  You miss when it was covered in documents that you could freely scatter everywhere, but for some reason, the big cat started putting them away somewhere.

On the desk you can see an award.

Purrl thinks about the tiny jar of paint.

[on the desk] &gt;[13] push award
You bat at the award a few times, and it finally drops to the floor.

[on the desk] &gt;[14] down
You hop down off of the desk.

[on the floor] &gt;[15] get on bed
You get onto the bed.

The blanket has been stripped from the bed, but the pillow is still here.

Purrl looks at M.O.R.S.E.L., then at the award.

[on the bed] &gt;[16] look under pillow
As soon as the pillow moves, something much more interesting rolls out from under it!

[Your score has just gone up by two points.]

[on the bed] &gt;[17] push laser
You bat at the laser engraver a few times, and it finally drops to the floor.

[on the bed] &gt;[18] down
You hop down off of the bed.

You pick up the laser engraver.

[on the floor, holding a laser engraver] &gt;[2] get on purrl
Purrl reluctantly leans down for you, and you clamber awkwardly on top of her helmet.

[on Purrl, holding a laser engraver] &gt;[3] climb desk
You hop from Purrl&apos;s helmet onto the desk.

[on the desk, holding a laser engraver] &gt;[4] burn terminal


You use the engraver to draw a beautiful star pattern in the terminal, which becomes increasingly erratic and glitchy as you progress.  A lot of smoke comes out of it and collects near the ceiling.  You figure that&apos;s what made it work, because once it all escapes, the terminal stops working entirely.

Eventually a star-shaped hunk of smoldering metal comes loose and drops onto the desk.

Purrl gently pokes the spool of twine.

[Your score has just gone up by three points.]

[on the desk, holding a laser engraver] &gt;[5] push black star
You bat at the black star a few times, and it finally drops to the floor.

[on the desk, holding a laser engraver] &gt;[6] down
You hop down off of the desk.

Purrl blows some bubbles in her helmet.

[on the floor, holding a laser engraver] &gt;[7] drop laser
Dropped.

[on the floor] &gt;[8] get on purrl
Purrl reluctantly leans down for you, and you clamber awkwardly on top of her helmet.

[on Purrl] &gt;[9] push lily
You bat at the Lily figurine until it drops to the floor.

Purrl grumbles.

[on Purrl] &gt;[10] type star on keypad
You carefully type in the one word you&apos;re absolutely sure how to spell: STAR.  The machine chirps.

Purrl bats at her antenna.

[on Purrl] &gt;[11] push button


The machine whirrs for a moment.  A green light flashes on, and a gray star drops into the slot.

Purrl clears her throat loudly.

[Your score has just gone up by three points.]

[on Purrl] &gt;[12] push gray star
You bat at the gray star until it drops to the floor.

&quot;Mewo!!  That&apos;s enough, Star Anise!  Get off of me!!&quot;  Purrl shakes her head back and forth, sending you tumbling to the floor.

[on the floor] &gt;[13] down
You crouch down real low, to make it harder for enemies to spot you, which is foiled somewhat by the giant sparkling helmet you&apos;re wearing.

[on the floor] &gt;[14] decorate award with paint
(first taking the tiny jar of paint)


You pour the paint all over the acrylic star and smear it around with your paws.  Soon enough, you have a moderately sticky red star, which you look at proudly.  You also have red paint all over yourself and everything nearby.  Art is easy!

Purrl whispers to M.O.R.S.E.L.
.

[Your score has just gone up by three points.]

[on the floor, holding a tiny jar of paint] &gt;[15] search laundry
You toss some clothes in the air and generally have a great time.

Oh!  You spot something shiny under a jacket and dig it out.  It&apos;s a yellow star!

[Your score has just gone up by three points.]

[on the floor, holding a tiny jar of paint] &gt;[16] take scissors
In your excitement, you forget all about the tiny jar of paint you were holding and drop it.

You pick up the scissors.

[on the floor, holding some scissors] &gt;[17] cut paper


You do your very best to cut a star shape out of the paper.  It comes out absolutely perfect, of course.

[Your score has just gone up by three points.]

[on the floor, holding some scissors] &gt;[18] put glue on shop
You painstakingly write out your name in glue, real big.  You also put big scribbles of glue in places where stars could go.

[on the floor, holding some scissors] &gt;[19] put glitter on shop
You throw glitter haphazardly at the sticky parts.  Most of it gets on the floor, but eventually your name is spelled out across the front in big sparkly letters!

[Your score has just gone up by two points.]

[on the floor, holding some scissors] &gt;[20] put blue star on shop
You affix the blue star proudly to the front of your stall.

Purrl suspiciously eyes the blanket.

Purrl yawns.

[on the floor, holding some broken pieces of a mug] &gt;[14] get on purrl
Purrl reluctantly leans down for you, and you clamber awkwardly on top of her helmet.

[on Purrl, holding some broken pieces of a mug] &gt;[15] get on desk
You hop from Purrl&apos;s helmet onto the desk.

[on the desk, holding some broken pieces of a mug] &gt;[16] drop mug
Dropped.

[on the desk] &gt;[17] push mug
You bat at the mug a few times, and it finally drops to the floor.

The pieces of the mug are no worse for wear than they were before.

Purrl jumps up suddenly, then sits back down.

[on the desk] &gt;[18] down
You hop down off of the desk.

Neon&apos;s bedroom
The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the blinking LEDs on the tall machine in the corner.

The desk and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  Some shelves take up the opposite wall, stopping short of the corner to make room for a tall machine.  In the center of the room is a bed; it&apos;s framed by a nightstand and a closet door in the western wall.  The bedroom door to the east is, of course, closed.

Your new shop is taking shape!  It has a stall, and a name, and stars!

A little white pamphlet lies on the floor near the door.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, all of which is soft and comfortable under your paws.  Purrl has found a nice shirt to wrap around herself.  Also on the floor are some mug, some scissors, some paper scraps, a Lily figurine, a laser engraver, a glue stick, a bunch of stuff, a spool of twine, a bag of glitter, and a blanket.

(From down here, you can&apos;t see what&apos;s on the various raised surfaces around the room.)

You proudly set the mug atop your stall.

[on the floor] &gt;[20] take scissors

Neon&apos;s closet

A bunch of electronic junk is piled around the floor.

[on the floor, holding some scissors] &gt;[22] cut yarn
You snip through the yarn, and the puffball drops to the floor.  Wow!  That was easy!

The closet is spacious, which is exciting, but mostly contains clothes, which is not.  Back through the closet door is the bedroom.

A bunch of electronic junk is piled around the floor.

You can also see a puffball here.

You pick up the puffball.

Neon&apos;s bedroom
The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the blinking LEDs on the tall machine in the corner.

The desk, with a drawer underneath, and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  Some shelves take up the opposite wall, stopping short of the corner to make room for a tall machine.  In the center of the room is a bed; it&apos;s framed by a nightstand and a closet door in the western wall.  The bedroom door to the east is closed, of course.

Your new shop is taking shape!  It has a stall, and a name, and stars, and even some treasure!

On the stall are some broken pieces of a mug.

A little white pamphlet lies on the floor near the door.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, all of which is soft and comfortable under your paws.  Purrl has found a nice shirt to wrap around herself.  Also on the floor are some scissors, some paper scraps, a tiny jar of paint, a Lily figurine, a laser engraver, a glue stick, a bunch of stuff, a spool of twine, a bag of glitter, and a blanket.

(From down here, you can&apos;t see what&apos;s on the various raised surfaces around the room.)

Purrl peers under the bed.

[on the floor, holding a puffball] &gt;[28] put puffball in shop
You proudly set the puffball atop your stall.

[on the floor] &gt;[29] take scissors
You pick up the scissors.

[on the floor, holding some scissors] &gt;[30] cut twine
You snip off a length of string.

[on the floor, holding some scissors] &gt;[31] put string in shop
You proudly set the length of string atop your stall.

Wow!  Three treasures!  That&apos;s enough to make it an official shop!  &quot;You did it, Star Anise!!&quot; you say to no one.

Purrl examines it suspiciously.  &quot;Mmmnn.  Okay, but I&apos;ll only buy things that are my favorite.  No garbage!!&quot;  She plucks it out of your hands.

Purrl sits next to the glue stick.

You jump on your stall and wave your arms around.  &quot;Hey hey hey Purrl hey Purrl!!  Look at my shop I made!!  Come check it out!!!!!!!!!&quot;

Purrl strolls over and peruses your many wares.  &quot;Mmmnn, I think I would like one string, please, mewo.&quot;  She hands you the coin, and you hand her the string.  She nods politely.  &quot;Thank you.&quot;  She walks a short distance away and tumbles to the floor, rolling around playing with her string.

Quite suddenly, the door slides open, revealing the big cat standing in the hallway.

Neon&apos;s eyes dart around the room.  The glitter everywhere, the mess in the closet, the state of her terminal...  &quot;WHAT did you DO to my ROOM??&quot; she bellows.

&quot;Wow!!&quot; you say.  &quot;I knew it would work!  Star Anise Shop to the rescue again!!&quot;  And you dart out the open door, leaving Neon to clean up the disaster you left in your wake.

You struggle and cry for help, but your captor ignores your feeble pleas.  They toss you, like garbage, into the darkness.  The heavy gate closes and locks behind you, sealing your fate.  Their maniacal laughter echoes into the distance, leaving you alone with your thoughts.

You are trapped.  Trapped...  in the Chamber of Despair.

Neon&apos;s bedroom
The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow coming from Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the tall machine in the corner.

The desk, with a drawer underneath, and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  Some shelves take up the opposite wall, stopping short of the corner to make room for a tall machine.  In the center of the room is a bed, unmade, a blanket hanging half off one side; it&apos;s framed by a nightstand and a closet door in the western wall.  The bedroom door to the east is, of course, closed.

A little white pamphlet lies on the floor near the door.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, all of which is soft and comfortable under your paws.

Neon&apos;s bedroom
The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow coming from Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the tall machine in the corner.

The desk, with a drawer underneath, and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  Some shelves take up the opposite wall, stopping short of the corner to make room for a tall machine.  In the center of the room is a bed; it&apos;s framed by a nightstand and a closet door in the western wall.  The bedroom door to the east is, of course, closed.

Your new shop is taking shape!  It has a stall!

A little white pamphlet lies on the floor near the door.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, all of which is soft and comfortable under your paws.  Purrl has found a nice shirt to wrap around herself.  Also on the floor are some scissors and a blanket.

(From down here, you can&apos;t see what&apos;s on the various raised surfaces around the room.)

[on the floor] &gt;[1] climb shelves
You make your way up the shelves.  They&apos;re too short for your helmet to fit in, so the best you can do is hold onto them like a ladder.

Purrl ignores the scissors.

[on the shelves] &gt;[2] knock stuff down
You methodically knock every single object off of the shelves.  While you&apos;re doing so, you take particular notice of a bag of glitter and a spool of twine.

Purrl thinks really hard.

[on the floor] &gt;[4] look under workbench
You peek around under the workbench, and way in the back by the wall, you spot a tiny jar of paint!  It must&apos;ve fallen off sometime.  Probably because you were batting it around.

You fish it out and clutch it excitedly in your paws.

[Your score has just gone up by two points.]

[on the floor, holding a tiny jar of paint] &gt;[5] drop
(the tiny jar of paint)
Dropped.

[on the floor] &gt;[6] look under desk
You crouch on all fours and peer under the desk.  Right there in front of you is a glue stick!  This is the high point of your day so far.

You roll it towards you and pick it up.

[Your score has just gone up by two points.]

Dropped.

Purrl wraps herself in a different shirt.

[on the floor] &gt;[8] get on workbench
You get onto the workbench.

The workbench is a warm painted wood, in stark contrast to the cold metal desk right next to it.  This is where the magic happens, if &quot;magic&quot; is the appearance of a lot of things that roll around.

On the workbench you can see a mug and some construction paper.

[on the workbench] &gt;[9] push mug
You bat at the mug a few times, and it finally drops to the floor.

The laundry cushioned its fall, but the mug didn&apos;t survive unscathed.  It&apos;s now chipped.

You bat at the construction paper a few times, and it finally drops to the floor.

[on the floor] &gt;[12] get on desk
You get onto the desk.

The metal desk is surprisingly sparse, occupied mainly by a glowing terminal.  You miss when it was covered in documents that you could freely scatter everywhere, but for some reason, the big cat started putting them away somewhere.

On the desk you can see an award.

Purrl bats at her antenna.

The blanket has been stripped from the bed, but the pillow is still here.

[on Purrl, holding a laser engraver] &gt;[3] climb desk
You hop from Purrl&apos;s helmet onto the desk.

[on the desk, holding a laser engraver] &gt;[4] burn terminal


You use the engraver to draw a beautiful star pattern in the terminal, which becomes increasingly erratic and glitchy as you progress.  A lot of smoke comes out of it and collects near the ceiling.  You figure that&apos;s what made it work, because once it all escapes, the terminal stops working entirely.

Eventually a star-shaped hunk of smoldering metal comes loose and drops onto the desk.

[Your score has just gone up by three points.]

[on the desk, holding a laser engraver] &gt;[5] push black star
You bat at the black star a few times, and it finally drops to the floor.

Purrl clears her throat loudly.

[on Purrl] &gt;[11] push button

Purrl snorts.

[on Purrl] &gt;[12] push gray star
You bat at the gray star until it drops to the floor.

&quot;Mewo!!  That&apos;s enough, Star Anise!  Get off of me!!&quot;  Purrl shakes her head back and forth, sending you tumbling to the floor.

[on the floor] &gt;[13] down
You crouch down real low, to make it harder for enemies to spot you, which is foiled somewhat by the giant sparkling helmet you&apos;re wearing.

[on the floor] &gt;[14] decorate award with paint
(first taking the tiny jar of paint)


You pour the paint all over the acrylic star and smear it around with your paws.  Soon enough, you have a moderately sticky red star, which you look at proudly.  You also have red paint all over yourself and everything nearby.  Art is easy!

[Your score has just gone up by three points.]

[on the floor] &gt;[15] search laundry
You toss some clothes in the air and generally have a great time.

Oh!  You spot something shiny under a jacket and dig it out.  It&apos;s a yellow star!

[on the floor] &gt;[16] take scissors
You pick up the scissors.

[on the floor, holding some scissors] &gt;[17] cut paper

You painstakingly write out your name in glue, real big.  You also put big scribbles of glue in places where stars could go.

[on the floor, holding some scissors] &gt;[19] put glitter on shop
You throw glitter haphazardly at the sticky parts.  Most of it gets on the floor, but eventually your name is spelled out across the front in big sparkly letters!

Oh!  Wow!  That&apos;s five stars, the perfect number of stars!  &quot;Good job, Star Anise!&quot; you say aloud.

pamphlet - thing

printed name: &quot;pamphlet&quot;
printed plural name: none

description: &quot;Welcome to interactive fiction!  I see you&apos;ve already got the basics down.

As you can see, the game understands basic English instructions like READ THE PAMPHLET, as well as some slightly fancier constructs like TAKE THE COOKIE FROM THE JAR, but that&apos;s as complex as it gets.

Tip: X is short for EXAMINE!

You flip through the rest of the pamphlet, which contains detailed instructions and a complete walkthrough, but there aren&apos;t any pictures!  Not one!  Worthless.&quot;
initial appearance: &quot;A little white pamphlet lies on the floor near the door.&quot;

The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow coming from Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the tall machine in the corner.

The desk and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  Some shelves take up the opposite wall, stopping short of the corner to make room for a tall machine.  In the center of the room is a bed; it&apos;s framed by a nightstand and a closet door in the western wall.  The bedroom door to the east is, of course, closed.

Your new shop is taking shape!  So far, that shape is a clearing on the floor.

A little white pamphlet lies on the floor near the door.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, all of which is soft and comfortable under your paws.  Purrl has found a nice shirt to wrap around herself.  Also on the floor is a blanket.

(From your vantage point atop Purrl, you can get a better look at the various raised surfaces around the room.)

Purrl bats at her antenna.

[on the floor] &gt;[1] climb shelves
You make your way up the shelves.  They&apos;re too short for your helmet to fit in, so the best you can do is hold onto them like a ladder.

[on the shelves] &gt;[2] knock stuff down
You methodically knock every single object off of the shelves.  While you&apos;re doing so, you take particular notice of a bag of glitter and a spool of twine.

Purrl gently pokes the spool of twine.

[on the shelves] &gt;[3] down
You hop down off of the shelves.

Neon&apos;s bedroom
The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow coming from Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the tall machine in the corner.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, all of which is soft and comfortable under your paws.  Purrl has found a nice shirt to wrap around herself.  Also on the floor are a bunch of stuff, a spool of twine, a bag of glitter, and a blanket.

(From down here, you can&apos;t see what&apos;s on the various raised surfaces around the room.)

[on the floor] &gt;[4] look under workbench
You peek around under the workbench, and way in the back by the wall, you spot a tiny jar of paint!  It must&apos;ve fallen off sometime.  Probably because you were batting it around.

You fish it out and clutch it excitedly in your paws.

[Your score has just gone up by two points.]

[on the floor, holding a tiny jar of paint] &gt;[5] drop
(the tiny jar of paint)
Dropped.

[on the floor] &gt;[6] look under desk
You crouch on all fours and peer under the desk.  Right there in front of you is a glue stick!  This is the high point of your day so far.

You roll it towards you and pick it up.

Purrl wanders around.

[Your score has just gone up by two points.]

[on the floor, holding a glue stick] &gt;[7] drop
(the glue stick)
Dropped.

[on the floor] &gt;[8] get on workbench
You get onto the workbench.

The workbench is a warm painted wood, in stark contrast to the cold metal desk right next to it.  This is where the magic happens, if &quot;magic&quot; is the appearance of a lot of things that roll around.

On the workbench you can see a mug and a construction paper.

[on the workbench] &gt;[9] push mug
You bat at the mug a few times, and it finally drops to the floor.

The laundry cushioned its fall, but the mug didn&apos;t survive unscathed.  It&apos;s now chipped.

[on the workbench] &gt;[10] push paper
You bat at the construction paper a few times, and it finally drops to the floor.

Purrl blows some bubbles in her helmet.

[on the workbench] &gt;[11] down
You hop down off of the workbench.

[on the floor] &gt;[1] get on purrl
Purrl reluctantly leans down for you, and you clamber awkwardly on top of her helmet.

[on Purrl] &gt;[2] open closet
You grasp the doorknob in both paws and wrestle with it a bit.  It unlatches, and the door swings open!  You did it!!

Purrl snorts.

[on Purrl] &gt;[3] get on nightstand
You hop from Purrl&apos;s helmet onto the nightstand.

[on the nightstand] &gt;[4] take scissors
You pick up the scissors.

[on the nightstand, holding some scissors] &gt;[5] down
You hop down off of the nightstand.

[on the floor, holding some scissors] &gt;[6] go in closet

Neon&apos;s closet
The closet is spacious, which is exciting, but mostly contains clothes, which is not.  Back through the closet door is the bedroom.

What really catches your eye is the cardboard box tucked in the corner.  It&apos;s been taped shut, and one side reads FRAGILE.

[on the floor, holding some scissors] &gt;[7] cut tape
You painstakingly cut at the tape, which is much more difficult than it seems with these scissors, but manage to free the box flaps!

[on the floor, holding some scissors] &gt;[8] open box
You open the cardboard box, revealing an electronic junk.

[on the floor, holding some scissors] &gt;[9] take junk
You grab bits and pieces at random and toss them over your shoulder, emptying the box one circuit board at a time.  The delicate components clatter as they hit the wall and floor behind you.

[on the floor, holding some scissors] &gt;[10] push box out
You shove the box ahead of you and manage to finagle it through the door.

Purrl sticks her tongue out at you when you&apos;re not looking.

[on the floor, holding some scissors] &gt;[11] flip box
You flip the box over, converting it elegantly into a stall for your shop!  You nudge it into position and gaze upon it with pride.

[on the floor, holding some scissors] &gt;[12] drop scissors
Dropped.

The metal desk is surprisingly sparse, occupied mainly by a glowing terminal.  You miss when it was covered in documents that you could freely scatter everywhere, but for some reason, the big cat started putting them away somewhere.

On the desk you can see an award.

Purrl gently pokes the scissors.

You bat at the award a few times, and it finally drops to the floor.

The blanket strewn haphazardly across the bed bears a circuit pattern, as well as a conspicuous lump in the middle.

On the bed is nothing.

On the nightstand is nothing.

On the desk is nothing.

On the workbench is nothing.

It has a keypad, a red button, and a large square recess, though all of it&apos;s out of your reach.

Neon&apos;s bedroom
The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow from the terminal on Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the strange machine in the corner.

The desk and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  shelves take up the opposite wall, except for a strange machine in the corner.  In the center of the room is a bed, unmade; on either side are a nightstand and a closet door.  The bedroom door is, of course, closed behind you.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, which is soft and nice to stand on.

The blanket strewn haphazardly across the bed bears a circuit pattern, as well as a conspicuous lump in the middle.

On the bed are nothing.

On the nightstand are nothing.

On the desk are nothing.

On the workbench are nothing.

You can also see a tiny jar of paint and an award here.

Neon&apos;s bedroom
The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow coming from Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the tall machine in the corner.

The desk, with a drawer underneath, and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  Some shelves take up the opposite wall, stopping short of the corner to make room for a tall machine.  In the center of the room is a bed, unmade, a blanket hanging half off one side; it&apos;s framed by a nightstand and a closet door in the western wall.  The bedroom door to the east is, of course, closed.

A little white pamphlet lies on the floor near the door.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, all of which is soft and comfortable under your paws.  Also on the floor are a bunch of stuff, a spool of twine, and a bag of glitter.

(From down here, you can&apos;t see what&apos;s on the various raised surfaces around the room.)

Welcome to interactive fiction!  You&apos;ve already got the basics down!

The game understands basic English actions like LOOK or READ THE LITTLE WHITE PAMPHLET, as well as slightly fancier constructs like TAKE THE COOKIE FROM THE JAR, but that&apos;s as complex as it gets.  (In particular, as with most IF games, you can&apos;t use three items together at once!)

If you&apos;re not familiar with the genre, it&apos;s all about interaction: LOOK around, EXAMINE objects that stand out.  You can interact with other characters with phrasing like ASK ANDRE FOR PAINTBRUSH, or directly ask them to do something with ANDRE, READ THE PAMPHLET.

Tip: there are lots of typing shortcuts!  You can refer to this pamphlet as just LITTLE, or WHITE, or PAMPHLET.  Also, X is short for EXAMINE!

You flip through the rest of the pamphlet, which contains detailed instructions and a complete walkthrough, but there aren&apos;t any pictures!  Not one!  Worthless.

Neon&apos;s bedroom
The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow coming from Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the tall machine in the corner.

The desk and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  Some shelves take up the opposite wall, stopping short of the corner to make room for a tall machine.  In the center of the room is a bed, unmade, a blanket hanging half off one side; it&apos;s framed by a nightstand and a closet door in the western wall.  The bedroom door to the east is, of course, closed.

From down here, you can&apos;t see what&apos;s on the various raised surfaces around the room: the bed, nightstand, desk, workbench, and shelves.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, all of which is soft and comfortable under your paws.  Also on the floor are a pamphlet, a glue stick, and a bag of glitter.

Neon&apos;s bedroom
The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow coming from Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the tall machine in the corner.

The desk and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  Some shelves take up the opposite wall, stopping short of the corner to make room for a tall machine.  In the center of the room is a bed, unmade, a blanket hanging half off one side; it&apos;s framed by a nightstand and a closet door in the western wall.  The bedroom door to the east is, of course, closed.

From down here, you can&apos;t see what&apos;s on the various raised surfaces around the room: the bed, nightstand, desk, workbench, and shelves.

A little white pamphlet lies on the floor near the door.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, all of which is soft and comfortable under your paws.  Also on the floor are a glue stick and a bag of glitter.

Neon&apos;s bedroom
The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow coming from Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the tall machine in the corner.

The desk and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  Some shelves take up the opposite wall, stopping short of the corner to make room for a tall machine.  In the center of the room is a bed, unmade, a blanket hanging half off one side; it&apos;s framed by a nightstand and a closet door in the western wall.  The bedroom door to the east is, of course, closed.

A little white pamphlet lies on the floor near the door.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, all of which is soft and comfortable under your paws.  Also on the floor are a chipped mug, a glue stick, and a bag of glitter.

(From down here, you can&apos;t see what&apos;s on the various raised surfaces around the room.)

&gt;[1] pull blanket
You tug on the blanket.  It slides off the bed and on top of you, bringing its contents with it.  A little flailing manages to kick it off of you, and you&apos;re greeted by a scowling face.

Purrl crosses her arms.  &quot;Star Anise!!  What are you doing here!  I was taking a lovely nap, and then I had a nightmare that Star Anise woke me up, and then it wasn&apos;t a nightmare it was real!!  This is my sleep place that I found, go away!!&quot;

You adopt an action pose, to convey how much action you&apos;re currently ready for.  &quot;Oh!!!!!  Purrl!  I&apos;m so glad to see you!!  Listen we&apos;re trapped in the Chamber of Despair and I&apos;ve been trying to go away but I can&apos;t because of the trapped!  We gotta make a daringly cool escape!!  Do you have any explosives or maybe a cool gun.&quot;

&quot;No!  Let me nap!!!&quot;

&quot;Yeah!!  A nap after we escape sounds great!!  Team Star Purrl Anise Fish Squad let&apos;s go!!&quot;

[Your score has just gone up by five points.]

&gt;[2] show panel to purrl
You point up at the panel.  &quot;I think that opens the door!!  Also it glows a lot and I wanna touch it.  But it&apos;s too tall up!  Gimme a boost!&quot;

Purrl puts her paws squarely on her hips.  &quot;I&apos;m not giving you any boots!  Find something else to stand on!!&quot;

&quot;Like what??  Everything in here is real big or real shirt!&quot;  You stand on one of the dirty shirts on the floor.  &quot;Look it doesn&apos;t make me any taller at all!  Not even one taller!!  I can&apos;t escape like this!&quot;

&quot;Mmmmnnmnnmmnnnn.  I dunno.&quot;  Purrl licks her paw in a lovely manner.  &quot;But okay.  But only if you don&apos;t bother M.O.R.S.E.L.&quot;

[Your score has just gone up by five points.]

&gt;[3] climb purrl
You climb awkwardly on top of Purrl&apos;s helmet.

&gt;[4] touch panel
You try this a couple times, but to no avail.  &quot;It didn&apos;t work!!  Let me out you dumb lights thing!!&quot;

Purrl frowns up at your butt.  &quot;Can I go do more nap now?&quot;

&quot;No!!!  I have a new idea!!&quot;  You hop down off Purrl&apos;s helmet and kick some laundry around, making a clearing on the floor.  &quot;It&apos;s time to open Star Anise shop!!  It&apos;s the only way!!!!&quot;

&quot;I don&apos;t care about Star Anise shop!!!!&quot;  Purrl takes out her frustrations by helping you kick laundry.

The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow coming from Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the tall machine in the corner.

The desk and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  Some shelves take up the opposite wall, stopping short of the corner to make room for a tall machine.  In the center of the room is a bed, unmade, a blanket hanging half off one side; it&apos;s framed by a nightstand and a closet door in the western wall.  The bedroom door to the east is, of course, closed.

A little white pamphlet lies on the floor near the door.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, all of which is soft and comfortable under your paws.  Also on the floor is a bag of glitter.

(From down here, you can&apos;t see what&apos;s on the various raised surfaces around the room.)

The lights are off and there are no windows, but the room is lit well enough by the cyan glow coming from Neon&apos;s desk and the blinking LEDs on the tall machine in the corner.

The desk and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  Some shelves take up the opposite wall, stopping short of the corner to make room for a tall machine.  In the center of the room is a bed, unmade, a blanket hanging half off one side; it&apos;s framed by a nightstand and a closet door in the western wall.  The bedroom door to the east is, of course, closed.

A little white pamphlet lies on the floor near the door.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, all of which is soft and comfortable under your paws.

The desk and an adjacent workbench run along the entire length of one wall.  Some shelves take up the opposite wall, stopping short of the corner to make room for a tall machine.

A little white pamphlet lies on the floor near the door.

The floor is strewn with innumerable strata of dirty laundry, all of which is soft and comfortable under your paws.
